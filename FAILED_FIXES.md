STAR EMOJI DISPLAY FAILURE - NEEDS FIXING

ISSUE: Star emojis (‚≠ê) are NOT displaying correctly in the Constraint Grid for adjacent-pairing
ATTEMPTS: Multiple failed attempts to fix this issue
STATUS: Still broken - star emojis not showing in constraint grid cells
PRIORITY: HIGH - This is a core functionality issue

CURRENT STATE:
- Constraint grid shows X and & symbols correctly with black font
- Star emojis are NOT appearing for adjacent-pairing constraints
- Logic appears correct but visual display is broken

NEXT STEPS NEEDED:
1. Thoroughly debug why star emojis are not rendering in grid cells
2. Check if there are CSS/styling issues preventing star emoji display
3. Verify the isAdjacent logic is working correctly
4. Test with actual adjacent-pairing to confirm the issue

FAILED ATTEMPTS:
- Tried copying logic from old codebases
- Tried different color schemes
- Tried different constraint logic structures
- All attempts resulted in no star emoji display

This issue must be resolved before considering the feature complete.
